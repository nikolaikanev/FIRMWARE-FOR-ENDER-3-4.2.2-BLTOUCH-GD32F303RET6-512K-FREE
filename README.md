# FIRMWARE-FOR-ENDER-3-4.2.2-BLTOUCH-GD32F303RET6-512K-FREE
This is firmware for the Ender 3 printer with a BLTouch (5 pin connection). I use a replica named "3D Touch" from AliExpress that costs around 5 dollars, and everything works perfectly. Since there's no freely available software for this chip, I'm glad I can share it here with you. :)
